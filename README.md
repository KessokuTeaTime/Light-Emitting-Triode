# Light Emitting Triode

###### ...And God Said, Let There Be Light.

**Light Emitting Triode `LET`** is a Minecraft mod that provides you plenty of **redstone-controllable,** **decorative** **lamps** and **light sources.** It is also a reimplementation of the mod **[Light Emitting Diode `LED`](https://github.com/magistermaks/mod-led)** (which is awesome!) on higher Minecraft versions.
